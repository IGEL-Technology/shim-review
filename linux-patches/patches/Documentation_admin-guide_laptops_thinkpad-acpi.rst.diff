+Some newer Thinkpads have a feature called MAC Address Pass-through. This
+feature is implemented by the system firmware to provide a system unique MAC,
+that can override a dock or USB ethernet dongle MAC, when connected to a
+network. This property enables user-space to easily determine the MAC address
+if the feature is enabled.
+
+The values of this auxiliary MAC are:
+
+        cat /sys/devices/platform/thinkpad_acpi/auxmac
+
+If the feature is disabled, the value will be 'disabled'.
