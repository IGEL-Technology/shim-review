# IGEL Kernel Patches

This directory contains the individual patches, one per file, from the combined patch in the parent directory. It has been generated by calling (in the parent directory):

```
rm patches/*.diff
./split_patches.awk <linux-*.diff
```

All path delimiters have been replaced by underscores, resulting in a flat directory structure while still allowing to see which source file a patch refers to. If another format, or subdirecctories, are preferred, please open an issue for it and let us know.
