 The capabilities security module does not use the general security
 blobs, unlike other modules. The reasons are historical and are
 based on overhead, complexity and performance concerns.

+LSM External Interfaces
+=======================
+
+The LSM infrastructure does not generally provide external interfaces.
+The individual security modules provide what external interfaces they
+require.
+
+The file ``/sys/kernel/security/lsm`` provides a comma
+separated list of the active security modules.
+
+The file ``/proc/pid/attr/display`` contains the name of the security
+module for which the ``/proc/pid/attr/current`` interface will
+apply. This interface can be written to.
+
+The infrastructure does provide an interface for the special
+case where multiple security modules provide a process context.
+This is provided in compound context format.
+
+-  `lsm\0value\0lsm\0value\0`
+
+The `lsm` and `value` fields are nul terminated bytestrings.
+Each field may contain whitespace or non-printable characters.
+The nul bytes are included in the size of a compound context.
+The context ``Bell\0Secret\0Biba\0Loose\0`` has a size of 23.
+
+The file ``/proc/pid/attr/context`` provides the security
+context of the identified process.
